Bluecable API is a 'Business Webservice' with OAuth system for login and logout integrated with Google. It has a data form where the user can record information about customer renegotiations. The service's functions range from manipulating and storing data via a non-relational database. The application is integrated with the Firebase platform for data managementa and login authorizations with link validation via Google Cloud. It is also versioned by Github and implemented by the Vercel platform.

Step 1:

In the last blue option "Create an account for free" you can create an account using just a random standard format (it doesn't have to be an existing account) example: "mike123@gmail.com", or you can register a real account using google in the red option "Entre com o google", your password must contain at least 6 digits.

Step 2: 

Logging in with your login and password will take you to the home page with the data registration fields. This data is sent to an online data store called "firebase" and can be queried and manipulated via the "Query" tab.

Step 3:

In the "Consultation" tab you can see all the renegotiations registered with the bank and you can manipulate the information with the green button or delete the record with the red button.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
